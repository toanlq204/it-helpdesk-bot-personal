#### Test Case 4.3: Processing Mode Selection
**Input**: "Use vector search only for printer driver information"
**Expected Behavior**:
- Recognizes mode specification
- Uses only vector search (not full RAG)
- Respects user's processing preference

## Advanced Integration Tests

### Test Case 5.1: All Features Combined
**Input**: "I can't connect to office Wi-Fi, search the knowledge base for solutions, walk me through troubleshooting, and if it doesn't work create a high priority ticket"
**Expected Behavior**:
1. Vector search for Wi-Fi issues
2. LangChain-powered guided troubleshooting
3. Function calling for ticket creation
4. Multi-query processing handling all requests

### Test Case 5.2: Voice and Audio Features
**Input**: Any query with Enhanced Mode enabled
**Expected Behavior**:
